<!-- Lesson Pages 1–35 -->
<!-- Page 1 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page1">
  <h2>Introduction to Internet Safety & Passwords</h2>
  <p>The internet is an incredible tool. You can learn, create, communicate, and explore new ideas. But it also has dangers—hackers, scams, and identity theft can threaten your personal information. One of the most important ways to protect yourself online is with strong passwords. A password acts like a key to your accounts and personal data, so it needs to be hard to guess. Weak passwords are one of the top reasons accounts get hacked. By learning about password safety, you are taking a huge step in protecting yourself online. Remember, no one else should know your passwords.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> List 3 online accounts you use frequently. Rate your current password for each as weak, medium, or strong.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 2 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page2">
  <h2>Characteristics of Strong Passwords</h2>
  <p>A strong password is long, complex, and unpredictable. It should include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words, repeated patterns, or personal information. Longer passwords are harder to crack than shorter ones. You should also use different passwords for different accounts. Strong passwords protect you from hackers and identity theft. They may take a bit more effort to create, but they are worth it. Using a password manager can help you store them safely.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Create 2 strong passwords for two different accounts without writing personal info.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 3 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page3">
  <h2>Passphrases – Easy to Remember, Hard to Guess</h2>
  <p>Passphrases are combinations of words that form a sentence or phrase. They are easier to remember than random strings of letters and symbols. A passphrase can still be strong if it has enough length and complexity. For example, "BluePizzaRunsFast!2025" is long and unique. Passphrases are ideal for protecting accounts without needing to write passwords down. Using multiple unrelated words can make it harder for hackers to guess. You can also mix in numbers or symbols to increase strength. Passphrases give a good balance of security and memorability.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Create a passphrase using your favorite color, animal, and number. Example: "GreenTiger42Rocks!"</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 4 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page4">
  <h2>Avoiding Personal Information in Passwords</h2>
  <p>Using birthdays, names, or pets in passwords is risky because hackers can find this info online. Social media often makes this information public. Weak personal passwords can be cracked easily with automated tools. Avoid including your address, favorite team, or school name. Create abstract or random phrases instead. Combining unrelated words, numbers, and symbols is safer. Think of it like creating a secret code that only you understand. Protecting personal info is a big step toward online security.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Look at your current passwords and identify which ones include personal info. Rewrite them in a safer, abstract format.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 5 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page5">
  <h2>The Danger of Reusing Passwords</h2>
  <p>Using the same password for multiple accounts is dangerous. If one account is hacked, all accounts using the same password are at risk. Hackers often try known passwords on multiple platforms. Each account should have a unique, strong password. Password managers make it easier to maintain different passwords. Regularly updating passwords also increases security. Remember, convenience should not outweigh safety. Protecting your online accounts requires diligence and planning.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Make a list of accounts that share the same password. Plan to update them with unique, strong passwords this week.</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page6">
  <h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
  <p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security beyond your password. Even if a hacker gets your password, they cannot access your account without the second factor. This could be a text message code, an authentication app, or a security key. Many platforms now support 2FA, including email, social media, and banking. Using 2FA greatly reduces the chances of unauthorized access. Always enable it on accounts with sensitive information. It only takes a few minutes but greatly enhances security. Treat it as a safety net for your accounts.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Enable 2FA on at least one of your accounts.</div>

  <h2>Final Project – Personal Security Plan</h2>
  <p>Now that you have learned about passwords, 2FA, backups, malware, and online safety, it’s time to create a personal security plan. Include strong passwords, unique passwords for each account, and two-factor authentication. Make a list of important accounts and review their security settings. Plan how to update passwords regularly. Include steps for safe device use and recognizing threats. Consider safe online shopping and managing social media privacy. This plan will help you stay secure online for years to come. Protecting your digital life is a skill that grows with practice.</p>
