<div class="lesson-page" id="page1">
<h2>Internet Safety Basics</h2>
<p>The internet is an incredible tool for learning, gaming, socializing, and exploring new ideas. However, it also comes with risks like hacking, phishing, malware, and scams. Understanding internet safety and protecting your passwords are essential first steps to keeping your personal information secure.</p>
<p>Strong passwords are like strong locks on doors. Without them, hackers can easily get in. Think of your passwords as keys to all your online accounts, and treat them with care.</p>
<div class="exercise">Mini Exercise: List 3 online accounts you use frequently. Think about the strength of your current passwords for each.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page2">
<h2>Why Passwords Matter</h2>
<p>Passwords protect your personal information. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for hackers to steal your accounts. Accounts can include email, social media, gaming, school platforms, or banking apps. If a hacker gets access to one, they may access others.</p>
<p>Passwords are your digital first defense. Strong, unique passwords reduce the chance of hacking and identity theft. Always aim to create complex and unique passwords for every account.</p>
<div class="exercise">Mini Exercise: For each account you listed in the previous page, label your password as weak, medium, or strong.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page3">
<h2>Strong Password Rules</h2>
<p>Strong passwords are long (12+ characters), include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words, patterns, or personal information that hackers can guess easily.</p>
<p>Example strong passwords: <strong>Blue!Tiger42Moon</strong>, <strong>Sun$Rise_2025!</strong>. Notice how they mix letters, numbers, and symbols, and aren’t simple dictionary words.</p>
<div class="exercise">Mini Exercise: Create two strong passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols. Try to make them easy to remember but hard to guess.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page4">
<h2>Password Mistakes</h2>
<p>Common mistakes include using your name, birthday, pet’s name, or simple sequences like “123456” or “abcdef.” Hackers know these are common and can crack them quickly.</p>
<p>Also, reusing the same password across multiple accounts is risky. If one account is hacked, all accounts with that password are compromised.</p>
<div class="exercise">Mini Exercise: Pick one weak password you currently use and rewrite it in a stronger, more secure format.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page5">
<h2>Password Reuse Risks</h2>
<p>Using the same password on multiple sites is dangerous. Hackers often steal credentials from one website and try them on others. This is called “credential stuffing.”</p>
<p>Always use unique passwords for each account. If remembering many passwords is hard, use a password manager (covered in later pages).</p>
</div>

<!-- Pages 6–15 -->

<div class="lesson-page" id="page6">
<h2>Password Managers</h2>
<p>Password managers safely store all your passwords in one secure app. They can generate complex passwords, autofill logins, and reduce the temptation to reuse passwords.</p>
<p>Examples of popular password managers: LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password. They encrypt your data so only you can access it.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page7">
<h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
<p>2FA adds an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has your password, they cannot log in without a second verification step, like a code sent to your phone or generated by an app.</p>
<p>Always enable 2FA on important accounts like email, social media, and banking.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page8">
<h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
<p>Phishing tricks users into revealing passwords or personal information through fake emails, messages, or websites. These often look very real, pretending to be a bank, school, or social media platform.</p>
<p>Always check the sender and URL, and never click suspicious links or enter your password on unknown sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page9">
<h2>Public Wi-Fi Risks</h2>
<p>Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure. Hackers can monitor data transmitted on these networks, including passwords and messages. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi or use a trusted VPN to encrypt your connection.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page10">
<h2>Secure Browsing</h2>
<p>Always look for HTTPS in the URL, which means your connection is encrypted. Avoid websites that seem suspicious, have poor grammar, or ask for excessive personal information.</p>
<p>Use browser security features and keep your browser updated for better protection.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page11">
<h2>Social Media Safety</h2>
<p>Keep your accounts private, control who can see your posts, and avoid oversharing personal information. Hackers can use information you post to guess passwords or answer security questions.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page12">
<h2>Email Security</h2>
<p>Email accounts are a gateway to many online services. Secure your email with strong passwords and 2FA. Be cautious of emails asking you to click links or download attachments.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page13">
<h2>Gaming Account Protection</h2>
<p>Gamers are frequent targets for account theft. Avoid sharing login details, use unique passwords, and enable 2FA when possible. Hackers can steal items, in-game currency, or personal info.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page14">
<h2>Device Security</h2>
<p>Keep your devices secure with screen locks, passcodes, and automatic updates. Install apps only from trusted sources and avoid jailbreaking or rooting your devices.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page15">
<h2>Updating Passwords</h2>
<p>Regularly update your passwords, especially after hearing about a data breach. Changing passwords reduces the risk of long-term exposure.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page21"><h2>Privacy Settings</h2><p>Adjust privacy settings on all accounts to control who can see your content. Limit sharing location and sensitive info.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page22"><h2>Backups</h2><p>Regularly backup important files and account info. Cloud backups are convenient, but ensure they are encrypted and secure.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page23"><h2>Digital Footprint</h2><p>Posts and images you share online can last forever. Be mindful of what you post and who can see it.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page24"><h2>Password Sharing</h2><p>Never share passwords casually. Only trusted family members or guardians should have access when absolutely necessary.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page25"><h2>Review Quiz</h2><p>Review your notes, check all security settings, and test your knowledge on password safety.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page26"><h2>Account Recovery</h2><p>Secure recovery email and phone numbers are essential. Make sure they are current and not easily guessed.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page27"><h2>Fake Apps</h2><p>Check reviews, developer info, and permissions before installing apps. Delete suspicious apps immediately.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page28"><h2>Encryption</h2><p>Encryption secures your data, making it unreadable to hackers. Use encrypted messaging and email when possible.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page29"><h2>Keyloggers</h2><p>Keyloggers record what you type, including passwords. Use antivirus, avoid suspicious downloads, and watch for unusual behavior.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page30"><h2>Cloud Storage Safety</h2><p>Keep cloud storage secure with strong passwords, 2FA, and limited sharing settings. Check activity logs regularly.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page31"><h2>Parental Controls</h2><p>Used responsibly, parental controls help protect young users. Adjust content, app access, and screen time for safety.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page32"><h2>Social Engineering</h2><p>Hackers manipulate people to give sensitive info. Always verify requests for data and never feel pressured to share passwords.</p></div>
<div class="lesson-page" id="page33"><h2>Data Breaches</h2><p>Check websites like “Have I Been Pwned” to see if your account info has been leaked. Change affected passwords immediately.</p></div>
