<h2>Introduction to Internet Safety & Passwords</h2>
<p>The internet is a powerful tool that allows you to learn, communicate, and explore. However, it also comes with risks such as hackers, scams, and identity theft. One of the best ways to protect yourself is by using strong passwords. Think of a password like a key to a treasure chest—if someone gets it, they can access your personal accounts. Strong passwords keep your emails, social media, and gaming accounts safe. This lesson will help you understand why passwords matter. By the end, you will know how to create secure passwords and keep your online accounts safe.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Write down three accounts you use and assess the strength of each password.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page2">
<h2>Characteristics of Strong Passwords</h2>
<p>A strong password is long, complex, and unpredictable. It should have at least 12 characters and mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessed words like your name or "password123." Strong passwords are harder for hackers to crack, keeping your accounts secure. Remember, complexity is key but don’t make it impossible to remember. Using passphrases or random combinations is an effective method. This page shows examples of weak versus strong passwords. Follow these tips to make your passwords both strong and memorable.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Create two strong passwords without personal info.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page3">
<h2>Passphrases – Easy to Remember, Hard to Guess</h2>
<p>Passphrases are combinations of words forming a sentence or phrase. They are easier to remember than random letters. For example, "BluePizzaRunsFast!2025" is long and secure. You can include numbers, punctuation, or symbols to increase strength. Passphrases reduce the chance of guessing attacks. They are especially useful for teenagers who want memorable but strong passwords. Using passphrases can significantly improve your online security.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Create a passphrase using a favorite color, animal, and number.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page4">
<h2>Avoiding Personal Information in Passwords</h2>
<p>Many people use their name, birthday, or pet's name in passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to guess using social media info. Avoid using personal info in passwords. Instead, use abstract words, symbols, and numbers. This ensures your password is unique and secure. Even simple changes like "Fluffy123" to "Star$Tiger!99" can increase security. Being creative is essential. Protecting personal information is critical to online safety.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Rewrite any password containing personal info into a safer version.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page5">
<h2>The Danger of Reusing Passwords</h2>
<p>Using the same password for multiple accounts is risky. If one account is hacked, all other accounts are vulnerable. Hackers often test stolen passwords on other services. Each account should have a unique password. Password managers can help you store them securely. Avoid shortcuts like "Password1!" across multiple accounts. Unique passwords reduce the chances of large-scale attacks. Always update repeated passwords to strong, unique ones.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Make a list of shared passwords and plan to update them.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page6">
<h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
<p>2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step. Even if a password is stolen, 2FA can protect accounts. Common methods include text codes, authenticator apps, or security keys. Many online services offer 2FA for free. Enabling it greatly reduces the risk of hacking. It’s simple to use and increases your online safety. Teens should always enable 2FA where possible. This ensures that your accounts stay secure.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Enable 2FA on one of your accounts today.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page7">
<h2>Using a Password Manager</h2>
<p>Password managers store your passwords securely in one place. They generate strong, random passwords for each account. You only need to remember one master password. Password managers can also autofill login forms securely. Using one helps prevent password reuse and weak passwords. Popular options include LastPass, 1Password, and Bitwarden. Make sure your master password is very strong. Password managers make password management much easier and safer.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Set up a password manager and add two accounts.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page8">
<h2>Recognizing Phishing & Scam Emails</h2>
<p>Phishing emails trick users into giving personal info. They often appear legitimate and urgent. Look for suspicious links, sender addresses, and grammar errors. Never click on unknown links or download attachments from strangers. Verify emails by contacting the company directly. Recognizing phishing attempts protects your accounts and personal info. Stay cautious with all online communication. Being vigilant prevents hackers from gaining access.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Find an example of a phishing email online and explain the red flags.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page9">
<h2>Safe Public Wi-Fi Usage</h2>

Always assume public Wi-Fi may be unsafe.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Identify which apps you should avoid using on public Wi-Fi.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page10">
<h2>Mobile Device Security</h2>
<p>Keep devices locked with strong PINs or biometrics. Avoid using easy-to-guess codes like 1234. Update apps and operating systems regularly. Disable unnecessary permissions and location tracking. Install antivirus apps if available. Don’t click unknown links or download unverified apps. Being proactive keeps your phone secure. A secure device protects your accounts and personal information.</p>
<div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Review and update your mobile security settings.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page11">
<h2>Safe Online Gaming Practices</h2>
<p>Online gaming accounts are targets for hackers. Avoid sharing login details with anyone. Use strong, unique passwords for gaming platforms. Enable 2FA if available. Be cautious with in-game links and chat messages. Keep accounts tied to secure email addresses. Avoid repeating passwords used elsewhere. Gaming safely prevents stolen accounts and frustration.</p>
